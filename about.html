							<h4>Mischa Abakumova</h4>
							<h5>Imformation Architect</h5>
							<p>Mischa is an experiential designer and technologist with focus on creating narrative-rich, responsive environments. She uses technology to create deeply personal, poetic connections between people and spaces, often drawing inspiration from her experience with nature and nostalgia for Russian landscape. Her goal is to uncover the points of intersection between the human body and its environment - where narrative, body, movement and the place merge to make sense of the relationships, questioning the existing frameworks that shape the interaction and finding alternative methods for engaging and constructing relationship with the world around.<br>
